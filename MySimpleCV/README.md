# MySimpleCV

A school project to practice HTML.

## Challenge

Create a website using purely HTML5 language and the editor of your choice to display fictitious information from a curriculum vitae.

## Experience

As a practical Frontend Web Development activity for the second semester of graduation,
the rule was not to use CSS, just focus on understanding the role of each tag to compose a web page.

However, I couldn't resist the possibility of using Tailwind to style the page,
since it wouldn't be necessary to mess with CSS directly and I was already quite excited to get to know this tool.

I really enjoyed the experience.
