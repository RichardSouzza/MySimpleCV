# MySimpleCV
A school project to practice HTML.

## Objective
As a practical Frontend Web Development activity for the second semester of graduation,
the rule was not to use CSS, just focus on understanding the role of each tag to compose a web page.

However, I couldn't resist the possibility of using Tailwind to style the page,
since it wouldn't be necessary to mess with CSS directly and I was already quite excited to get to know this tool.

I really enjoyed the experience.
